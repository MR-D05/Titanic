This was my final project for my Introduction to Programming Course. It is written in Java. 

The requirement was to design, implement and test a Java application that reads a file containing data
related to passengers on the Titanic. It provides statistical results on the passengers including the total number of passengers on the Titanic, percentage of passengers who perished on the Titanic, percentage of Passengers who survived the sinking of the Titanic, percentage passengers who survived the sinking of the Titanic as a function of the
"Passenger" class, a list of the names of passengers who were less than 10 years old who perished on the
Titanic, and the count of the number of passengers as a function of the first letter of their last name. 

The design conforms to specific criteria: It uses command line arguments to send in the name of the pertinent file, uses a 2D array to store data, implements at least 2 Java classes, implements discrete methods for all functionality, implements a user-friendly menu at start-up to be used for user data-selection that continues to display unti the option "Q" is selected, appropriately handles invalid menu item, and keeps track of the elapsed time from the start of the application until the time the user quits the application.
